    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: [Current Date]</em></p>

    <p>At nyx.rs, your privacy is our core design principle. This service is built to be as anonymous and non-intrusive as possible.</p>

    <h2>Our Guarantees</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Accounts or Registration:</strong> We do not require you to create an account. You can use our service without providing any personal information like names, emails, or phone numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>No KYC (Know Your Customer):</strong> We will never ask you for identity documents. Our service is, and will always be, KYC-free.</li>
        <li><strong>Strict No-Log Policy:</strong> We do not log or store user IP addresses. Web server logs are disabled for personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal Data Storage:</strong> The only information we temporarily store is the data absolutely essential for processing your order with our upstream provider. This includes the service ID, the target link, and the quantity. This data is associated with a randomly generated Order ID and is not linked to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> The source code for this website and its backend is publicly available for anyone to inspect and audit. This ensures we are transparent about our practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Private Payments:</strong> We are in the process of implementing Monero (XMR) for payments to ensure your financial privacy is protected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Handle</h2>
    <p>
        When you place an order, you provide a target link (e.g., a social media profile). This link is sent to our upstream service provider (Spotboost.top) to fulfill the order. We are a relay; we do not control what our provider does with that information.
    </p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>
        Refunds, when applicable, will be processed without requiring any personal information or KYC.
