    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="question">Q: How does this work?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>nyx.rs is a relay service. You select a service, provide a link, and we place an order on your behalf with our upstream provider. We act as a privacy-preserving layer between you and the service provider.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Q: Do I need an account?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>No. This service is completely account-free.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Q: What is an Order ID?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>After you place an order, you will receive a unique Order ID (a UUID). This is your only proof of purchase. You MUST save it. You can use this ID on the homepage to check the status of your order at any time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Q: Is it safe to use?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>We are designed with privacy as the top priority. We don't log your IP, we don't require personal info, and our code is open source so you can verify our claims. However, as with any new service, you should proceed with caution.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">Q: What if my order fails or I need help?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Please contact us at the email address listed in the footer of the homepage. Provide your Order ID so we can investigate the issue with our provider.</p>
